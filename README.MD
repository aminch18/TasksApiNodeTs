# Node.JS API by dummie for dummies.
## Typed in TypeScript using Express framework & Mongoose library.
##### The following blockquotes have the things that you don't need to check inside the repo:
>Build folder that have the transpiled typescript code to javascript code, so if you are not a older java scripter probably will be so difficult to understand it, just ignore the content of this folder.

>The package-lock.json file will be created when you install all the dependencies defined in package.json.
So should be deleted when you clone the repository.


#### Follow these steps for install the tools & dependencies:
1. Install node.js in your computer.

2. Install MongoDb or use the docker-compose file for have a server in a container.

3. Open the repository with VSCode or Sublime or your preferr IDE.

4. Open a command line and just do npm install.

5. Open a command line and do npm run tsc:watch.

6. Return to the first command line and do npm run start.

7. I hope you have installed PostMan, if no download it and install it is a very useful tool for Backend development.
> Here I attached the link: https://www.postman.com/downloads/   
With postman you will be able to do the requests defineed in the routes of our TaskController.

8. Inside the repository exists an .json file that you can import in postman for do the diferent requests that our Api expose.
